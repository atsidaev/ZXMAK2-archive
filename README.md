# ZXMAK2

## ZX Spectrum Emulator - Virtual Machine

The project written in C# and needs only .NET framework 4 and DirectX 9.
Managed DirectX was removed and replaced with direct calls to native DirectX.
This is why it can run on any windows from Windows XP to Windows 10.
You can run it even on Linux under the Mono. But the graphics will be not so good as on DirectX.

This emulator is designed in the way to be Virtual Machine style. You can change emulated hardware just on the fly.

Full support for Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10 x86/x64.
Don't forgot to install DirectX 9!

2.9.3.4:
- first minor changes after CodePlex shut down; removed nuget and TFS settings linked to CodePlex

2.9.3.5
- Managed DirectX removed, the code rewritten to use direct calls to DirectX. Eliminated LoaderLock issue (Managed DirectX bug). Now emulator has full support of x64 mode. 

2.9.3.6

- fixed Kempston port decode setting for Spectrum 48 model. Now Timing_Tests-48k_v1.0.tap pass all tests again.
- moved a little change for joystick bug from MDX version (the last commit on CodePlex). I'm not sure if it can be reproduced with native DirectX. But moved this fix, because the fix is pretty easy.
- due to remove of MDX dependency, I set useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy="false" in ZXMAK2.exe.config, may be it will improve performance.
